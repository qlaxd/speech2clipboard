## 6. Narrative
Zs칩fia is a university student who needs to take extensive notes during her Hungarian literature lectures. She finds it difficult to keep up with typing as the professor speaks quickly and uses specialized terminology. She discovers Speech2Clipboard and installs it on her laptop. During lectures, she activates the application, which accurately transcribes the professor's explanations. The text is instantly available on her clipboard, allowing her to paste it into her note-taking application and add her own annotations. This saves her significant time and ensures she captures all the important information.
